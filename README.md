# LLD-Questions
To approach LLD problem there are two ways
1. Top down approach  (For games like snake ladder, tic tak toe, use this)- Here we start from big elements and then break them to small elements
2. Bottom up approach - Here we start from small elements and class and move towards their parent classes.
